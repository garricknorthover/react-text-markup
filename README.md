React App with Mark Up
Demo:" https://react-text-markup.herokuapp.com/"

My first React app

A simple app to add markup to test, in this case hashes, around text make it bold.
I used a regular exression to parse out the hashes
`replace(/#(.*?)#/ig, '<b>$1</b>')`,



I have still to get my head around handling state and the general structure but this component pattern thing is something that I want to learn more.
